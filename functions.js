// This function returns a random number between (and including both) minimum and maximum
function getRandomInteger (minimum, maximum) {
  minimum = Math.ceil(minimum) // minimum is inclusive
  maximum = Math.floor(maximum + 1) // maximum is exclusive so we add one
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum - minimum)) + minimum
}

// Povided Arrays
const nouns = ['dragons', 'toasters']

const verbs = ['walked', 'ran']

const adverbs = ['menacingly', 'intentionally']

const adjectives = ['wild', 'slippery']

const proNouns = ['they', 'we', 'you', 'he', 'she', 'I', 'it']

const openings = ['Once upon a time', 'I watched']

const closings = ['with extra cheese', 'the end']

// Instructions:

// Arrays:
// Each provided array (except for proNouns) must have at least 10 elements (words or phrases)
// Add/replace words to each array based on any theme you like (keep it tasteful!)
// You do not have to use the example words in any of the provided arrays

// Functions:

// First function:
// Create a function that outputs the text/value sent to it using console.log()
// There should be a newline ("\n") both before and after the value is output
// Name this function appropriately
// Note this function does not return any value

// Second function:
// Create a function that builds a sentence using the 7 provided arrays
// Using the provided getRandomInteger function you will randomly use content from each array based on the random number returned by getRandomInt.
// Because you are using an array the minimum value should always be zero
// The maximum value should be the array length - 1

// The sentence created (concatinated) inside this function should be structured like this:
//      Get a random element from the openings array and add it to your new sentence
//      add a space (and  punctuation if you wish)
//      next get a random element from the adjectives array and add it to your sentence
//      add a space (and  punctuation if you wish)
//      next get a random element from the nouns array and add it to your sentence
//      add a space (and  punctuation if you wish)
//      next get a random element from the pro_nouns array and add it to your sentence
//      add a space (and  punctuation if you wish)
//      next get a random element from the verbs array and add it to your sentence
//      add a space (and  punctuation if you wish)
//      next get a random element from the adverbs array and add it to your sentence
//      add a space (and  punctuation if you wish)
//      next get a random element from the adjectives array and add it to your sentence
//      add closing punctuation.

// Note Feel free to re-arrange your sentence as you wish, just make sure you use the 7 provided arrays
// Note add more arrays if you wish

// Name this function appropriately
// This function should return the completed sentence

// Program Flow:

// inside a loop that repeats 10 times

// Your program will call the "sentence creating" function that you are required to build
// using a new variable you will capture the returned value (the sentence) from this function. Name this variable appropriately

// next you will send this variable to the other function you created used for output
// this will result in your random sentence being output.

// Other considerations:
// Everyones code should be different
// This is a fun exercise so... have fun!
